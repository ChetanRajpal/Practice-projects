# AWS Elastic Container Service practice

 ECS is aws's managed container orchestrator and so being an orchestrator it's going to put it in the same family as a Docker swarm or a kubernetes but this is just one that's provided by AWS and is managed by AWS exclusively. ECS is also responsible for deploying and load balancing the application across multiple servers, with Docker or Docker compose it's kind of limited.
 
 Now there are two ways to deploy containers using ECS. ECS + Fargate and ECS + EC2
